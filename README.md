# Rubik's Cube Solver

I bet my friend I could write a Rubik's Cube solver in 24 hours, and here it is! (Take that, Patrick)
It follows the beginner's solution because I'm already familiar with it, and because it has relatively
fewer algorithms. I was able to generalize a lot of code in the process, but there is still a lot of
optimization left to do. 

I'd like to revisit this in the future and generalize the code even further to make adding additional
algorithms trivial. The code could be better, but so could the solution.
